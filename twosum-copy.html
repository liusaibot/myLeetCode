    <h1>Two Sum</h1>
    <h2>Difficulty: Easy</h2>
    <p>Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

        You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
        
        You can return the answer in any order.</p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
       
       const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
            let storage = {};

            for (let [index, num] of nums.entries()){
                //on first past, storage is empty
                if(storage[num] !== undefined) return [storage[num], index];
                //storage will store target - value at index as the key and index as the position
                storage[target-num] = index;

            };

       }

       var nums = [15,11,7,2]
       var target = 9;

       var result = twoSum(nums, target);

       console.log(result);
